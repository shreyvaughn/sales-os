## The 6 Phases

| Phase | Skills | What It Covers |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| **Foundation** | 5 | Business context, ICP, positioning, competitive intel, asset audit |
| **LinkedIn Profile** | 6 | Profile audit, headline, about, featured, experience, social proof |
| **LinkedIn Outreach** | 9 | Prospecting, DMs, follow-ups, objections, voice notes, engagement |
| **Email Outreach** | 10 | Deliverability, campaigns, copy, sequences, replies, segmentation |
| **Cross-Channel** | 5 | Omnichannel sequences, lead scoring, pipeline, reviews |
| **Optimization** | 4 | Performance analysis, automation planning, voice training |

## How It Works

1. **You provide context** — business docs, website, current campaigns, scripts
2. **Claude ingests everything** — builds a complete picture of your business
3. **Claude audits your current state** — finds what's broken and what's missing
4. **Claude rebuilds your outreach** — personalized to your offer, ICP, and voice
5. **You execute** — Claude keeps optimizing as you feed it performance data

**First 30 minutes:** You'll have a rewritten LinkedIn profile, a diagnosis of your email outreach, and a prioritized roadmap for your entire sales pipeline.

## Knowledge Base

Drop any of these into `/knowledge-base/`:

- Company overview / pitch deck
- Current email campaigns and templates
- LinkedIn DM scripts
- Website copy or landing pages
- Case studies and testimonials
- Sales call recordings or transcripts
- Performance metrics (reply rates, open rates, etc.)

The more context you provide, the more personalized your Sales OS becomes.
